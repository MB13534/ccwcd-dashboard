# LRE Starterkit

The LRE Starterkit can be used as a starting point for creating a fullstack JavaScript web application. The project represents the continuing evolution of the LRE Dashboards a shift from the Drupal tech stack to a custom fullstack JavaScript application.

This starter kit represents a common structure for a web application and consists of backend API (server side) and frontend single page application (client side). The backend API that handles all of the data while the frontend is the actual application that the user interacts with in their web browser. Both the backend and frontend use the Identity-as-a-Service provider AuthO (https://auth0.com/) to handle authentication/authorization.
