# Starting the Application

For the starterkit to work correctly, both the frontend and backend need to be running.

### Starting the Backend

Open up a terminal, navigate to the backend directory and run `npm dev`. This will start up the backend server on http://localhost:3005 and it will automatically reload whenever any file changes.

### Starting the Frontend

Open up a terminal, navigate to the frontend directory and run `npm start`. This will start up the frontend server on http://localhost:3000 it will automatically refresh whenever any file changes.
