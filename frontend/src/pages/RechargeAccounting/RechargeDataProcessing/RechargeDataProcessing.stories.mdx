# Recharge Accounting Data Processing and Import

The Recharge Accounting Data Processing and Import tool provides a multi-step tool for simplifying and reducing errors in the data import process. The process is broken out into three main sections: the initial data import and review, recharge slices QAQC, and finally, lagging the data.

## Initial Import and Review

The process begins by clicking the "Import Data" button which runs a function in the PostgreSQL database that copies data from Ruthanne's Excel Spreadsheet to a data table in the database. The user can then review the imported data in the table below. If they notice any errors in the data, they need to make edits to the Excel Spreadsheet and re-import the data.

## Recharge Slices QAQC

The next step in the process is to review any issues with recharge slices. This means reviewing any errors with URFs or Splits. If any errors are detected, the user can resolve the errors on this page. After resolving all errors, the user can then move on to step 3 where they can lag the data.

## Data Lagging

The final step in the process is actually lagging the data. The user selects a year and month and clicks the Lag Data button. Simple as that.
