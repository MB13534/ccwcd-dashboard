# Introduction to the Recharge Accounting System

The Recharge Accounting System is a standalone application in many ways. The system allows CCWCD to import data (Recharge and URF data), manage recharge water slices, manage monthly and default splits, and perform QAQC to make sure their recharge accounting is in order.

Key pages of the Recharge Accounting System are as follows:

- Home (recharge accounting home page dashboard)
- WaterSlices (water slices management)
- Splits (recharge splits management)
- URFs (URFs data management)
- RechargeData (home page for recharge data management/import)
- RechargeDataProcessing (collection of pages related to recharge data import and lagging)
- QAQC (standalone QAQC page for fixing splits and URFs issues)
